# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Casey.

I'm a Front End Developer who enjoys learning more about accessibility, web development best practices, and how to become a better, more efficient human overall. I do this by reading books, taking courses, building projects, and posting about things I learn. I even started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLy7uZaVQ7nl5kBpixhH5wA) where I'm beginning to catalog things I've learned.

What makes me passionate about the technology industry is that there is a place for anyone here, as long as they put in consistent time and focus to learn. Learning how to code opens up opportunities to work on interesting projects that impact real change while earning a great living. It's also a rewarding career where the far majority of people in it are friendly, smart, curious, and encouraging.
