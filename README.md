# Hello, World!

I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Accessibility Enginneer who enjoys learning more about web accessibility, design systems, and user experience. I do this by reading books, taking courses, building projects, and posting about things I learn.

What keeps me interested in the technology industry is that I get to learn something new just about every day.

## A little more about me

You can read more about me on [my website's about page](https://www.caseyocampo.com/about/).

## Projects

I've pinned my favorite projects below.

If you prefer to view these projects outside of GitHub, visit the [projects page on my website](https://www.caseyocampo.com/projects). 

Note: making these projects more accessible is on my personal To Do List!
