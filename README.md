# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi, I'm Casey ðŸ‘‹.

I'm an Accessibility Enginneer who enjoys learning more about web accessibility, design systems, and user experience. I do this by reading books, taking courses, building projects, and posting about things I learn.

What keeps me interested in the technology industry is that I get to learn something new just about every day.
